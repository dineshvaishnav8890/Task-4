|--------------|-------------------------------|
| `main`       | Stable production-ready code  |
| `dev`        | Integrated development branch |
| `feature-1`  | New feature development       |

## 📌 Git Workflow Followed

1. Initialized local Git repository.
2. Created and pushed to GitHub.
3. Created branches: `dev`, `feature-1`.
4. Worked in `feature-1`, committed changes.
5. Created a Pull Request (PR) from `feature-1` → `dev`.
6. Merged `dev` into `main` once tested.
7. Created version tag `v1.0`.
